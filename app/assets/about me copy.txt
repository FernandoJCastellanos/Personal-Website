A tech head with an eye for design.
With an Advertising degree, I interned for a while as a film Production Assistant and soon after got hired to work for an Ad Agency as video/production (‘17). After that, I moved on to pursue a career as a freelancing 2D/3D Motion Designer. By the end of 2021 I decided to branch out and try out programming since its already so close to what I already do in Houdini might as well try.
Committed to moving on from being a “starving artist”. Went deep into Computer Science and the Programing/Coding rabbit hole. After about a year, I’m happy and confident to be able to look out for work!

Cheers!
